# email-server
A basic email server 

First of all you will need a server to get started you can use a vps(virtual private server) , persnal server or a virtual machine if you just want some practise
Once you have your server ready you will need a os to run your service and pacakages . some suggested options are ubantu server , debian server , arch based server or windows server just make sure that you understand the licences but ubantu server is an opensource project which is free and recommanded


in this tutorial we are gonna try this project with ubantu server so first let's install it in virtual box

first you need to install ubantu server from the official website
https://ubuntu.com/download/server

while instalation is in process open virtual box and assign atleast 10 GB storage and 800 mb ram to your server once installation is completed you need to attach the iso file to your virtual box and install it

while installation just download the kernal and choose openssh server which is needed for our project and add your username , servername , password and login into your ubantu server
